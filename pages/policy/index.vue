    <p class="leading-5 my-4">
      You may return new unworn and containing all original packaging and tags
      items within 14 days of receipt of goods for a full refund. Request for
      return must be received within 3 business days of receipt of items. We'll
      also pay the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error
      (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.).
    </p>
    <p class="leading-5">
      You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of giving your
      package to the return shipper, however, in many cases you will receive a
      refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to
      receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it
      takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days),
      and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10
      business days).
